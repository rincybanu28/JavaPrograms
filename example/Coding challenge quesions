Q.1
Second Smallest:
----------------
Your task here is to implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your code should match the specifications in a precise manner. Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless mentioned otherwise.

Specifications:
class definitions:
class Source:
visibility: public
method definitions:
getSecondSmallest(int []arr): accept an array of integer elements and return
the second smallest element in the arrayreturn type: int
visibility: public

Task
Create a Source class and implement below given method:
• getSecondSmallest(int []arr): accept an array of integer elements and return the second
smallest element in the array

Sample Input:
23, 45, 32, 22, 20, 96
Sample Output:
22

Q.2
Distance Traveled
-----------------
Problem Statement:
Write a program to calculate the distance traveled by car at different time intervals. The initial velocity of the car is 36km/hr and the constant acceleration is 5 m/s2.
The formula to calculate distance is:
Distance Traveled = u*t+((a*t*t)/2) where,
u = initial velocity of the car (36 km/hr)
a = acceleration of the car (5 m/s )
t = time duration in seconds

The program should accept 2-time intervals as the input (one-time interval per line) and print the distance travelled in meters by car (one output per line).
Definitions:
1 kilometer = 1000 meters
1 hour = 3600 seconds
Sample Input
10
8
Sample Output
350
240

Q.3
Write a java program to validate the age of a person and display proper message by using user defined exception. 
Age of a person should be above 15.
Your task here is to implement a Java code based on the following specifications. Note that your
code should match the specifications in a precise manner. 
Consider default visibility of classes, data fields and methods unless mentioned otherwise.
Specifications:
class definitions:
class MyException: Define exception
class Source:
method definitons:
checkAge(int age): throw a user defined exception if age is smaller than 15
visibility: public
Task
• Define MyException class
• Create a class Source and implement the below given method
• String checkAge(int age): throw a user defined exception if age is smaller than 15
Sample Input
22
Sample Output
valid
